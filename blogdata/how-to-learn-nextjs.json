These are essential for building and running Next.js applications. Open your command line and check:<\/p>\r\n      <pre><code>node -v\r\nnpm -v<\/code><\/pre>\r\n      <p>If you don't have them, download and install them from <a href=\"https:\/\/nodejs.org\/\">nodejs.org<\/a>. Then, create a new project folder and navigate to it:<\/p>\r\n      <pre><code>mkdir my-nextjs-app\r\ncd my-nextjs-app<\/code><\/pre>\r\n      <h3>Step 2: Installing Next.js<\/h3>\r\n      <p>Once in your project folder, install Next.js using npm:<\/p>\r\n      <pre><code>npm install next<\/code><\/pre>\r\n      <p>This will install Next.js and its dependencies in your project.<\/p>\r\n      <h3>Step 3: Hello, Next.js!<\/h3>\r\n      <p>Time for your first Next.js app! Create a file named <code>pages\/index.js<\/code> and add the following code:<\/p>\r\n      <pre><code>function Home() {\r\n  return <div>Hello, Next.js!<\/div>;\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Home;<\/code><\/pre>\r\n      <p>Now, start your Next.js app:<\/p>\r\n      <pre><code>npm run dev<\/code><\/pre>\r\n      <p>Open your browser and go to <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:3000\">http:\/\/localhost:3000<\/a>.

The <code>getStaticProps<\/code> function helps you fetch and render data statically.<\/p>\r\n      <!-- Continue with other Next.js features -->\r\n    <\/section>\r\n    <section>\r\n      <h2>\uD83D\uDE80 Deploying Your Next.js App<\/h2>\r\n      <p>Ready to share your masterpiece with the world?
